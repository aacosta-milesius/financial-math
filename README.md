# financial-math

## actuary.py
## This contains actuarial functions and many more financial function goodies.
Originally written in Mathematica, then translated to VBA, it made its way into Python.

1. Annuities
  * Annuity Due
  * Annuity Immediate
  * Decreasing Annuity
  * Increasing Annuity
2. Bonds
  * Basic Model
  * Premium/Discount
  * Base Amount
  * Makeham
3. Depreciation
  * Straight-line
  * Declining balance
  * Sum of the Years Digits

## demo-actuary.py
## This is Python code that demonstrates a 36-month amortization loan of $120,000.
Change the parameters around to try out the functions. The monthly balance should always
be the same for both prospective and retrospective methods.

## Actuary.xls
## The same actuarial functions, but in Excel, using VBA.
Much of this was the original material I used when teaching finacial mathematics.
